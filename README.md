# Diffirential amplifier 

**Whats is a diffirential amplifier ?**

A differential (or difference) amplifier is a two-input circuit that amplifies only the difference between its two inputs.

     Vout = A * (Vin+ - Vin-)
     where A is the gain of the amplifier

**Why diffirential amplifier is preferred than mosfet ?**

A differential amplifier is generally preferred over a single MOSFET because it offers superior noise rejection by actively canceling out common-mode noise (noise present on both input signals), making it ideal for applications where clean signal amplification is crucial, especially in environments with high electrical interference , whereas a single MOSFET only amplifies the signal on one input, making it more susceptible to common-mode noise. 

Common-mode rejection:

The primary advantage of a differential amplifier is its ability to significantly suppress common-mode noise, which is noise present on both input lines simultaneously. 

High input impedance:

Differential amplifiers generally have high input impedances, minimizing loading effects on the signal source. 

Flexibility in design:

They can be easily implemented using various transistor types, including MOSFETs, allowing for customization depending on the application. 

**Question :**

Design and Analyze the Differential Amplifier for the following specs, Vdd=2.2V, P<=2.2mW, Vicm=1.2V, Vocm=1.25V, Vp=0.4V. Perform DC analysis, Transient Analysis, Frequency Response and extract the parameters.

<pre>
  
Given,  P = 2.2mW
        P = V*I
        Iss = P/V = 2.2m/2.2 = 1mA
        Iss = 1mA

  Id1 = Id2 = Iss/2

Therefore, Id1 = 0.5mA

To Find Rd :
  
        Rd = Vdd - Vocm / Id1
        
        Subs Id1 in Rd

        Rd = 2.2 - 1.25 / 0.5m = 1.9kohm

By Ohm's Law,
        Rss = Vd/Iss = 0.4/1m = 400ohm

Qpoint : (Vds, Id)Vgs

 Vds = Vd - Vs = 1.25 - 0.4 = 0.85V

Therefore, (0.85V, 0.5m)1.2V

# Procedure

Step 1: DC Analysis

The goal in DC analysis is to find the operating point of the circuit (also known as the quiescent point) where the circuit is biased.

**Increase Vicm to 1V and Observe Vocm, Vp**

‚Ä¢ Vicm is the common-mode input voltage. When you set Vicm to 1V, you're setting the common-mode voltage at the input of the differential amplifier to 1V.

‚Ä¢ Vocm is the output common-mode voltage, which should be observed and ideally remain at a desired level (typically set by the biasing network).

‚Ä¢ Vp refers to the peak voltage, which should be related to the output swing.

Step 2: Transient Analysis

Calculate Maximum Input Swing and Output Swing.

‚Ä¢ The maximum input swing refers to how much you can vary the input signal without causing distortion or clipping at the output.

‚Ä¢ This is determined by the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and the input voltage range that keeps the transistors in the active region.

‚Ä¢ Maximum output swing refers to how much the output can vary while still staying in the linear region.

‚Ä¢ The output will be limited by the power supply voltages (for instance, if powered with ¬±Vcc, the output will be constrained between ¬±Vcc).


Calculate Gain if the Output is Linear.

‚Ä¢ If the output is still linear (i.e., no distortion or clipping), you can calculate the gain by:

Gain(ùê¥ùë£)= Œîùëâout / Œîùëâin

‚Ä¢ You can use this ratio to determine how effectively the input signal is being amplified by the circuit.

Step 3: AC Analysis

‚Ä¢ In AC analysis, we examine the frequency response of the circuit to find the bandwidth.

‚Ä¢ The 3-dB bandwidth is the frequency range where the gain of the amplifier falls to 70.7% (or -3 dB) of its maximum value.

Replacing the resistor Rss with a current source in a MOS differential amplifier enhances performance by increasing gain due to the higher output resistance of the current source. It stabilizes current flow, ensuring consistent biasing and reducing sensitivity to power supply fluctuations. This also improves the  common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) , leading to better rejection of common-mode signals. Additionally, the steady current reduces distortion and enhances signal fidelity by maintaining linearity, while the current source operates more efficiently, minimizing power waste. Overall, this modification results in a more stable, efficient, and high-performance amplifier.

 ## Circuit 3

If the resistor Rss is replaced by a MOSFET in a MOS differential amplifier, it can offer similar benefits to using a current source, but with some additional advantages. The MOSFET can be operated in its saturation region to act as a current source, providing high output resistance and improving the amplifier‚Äôs gain. This configuration offers better voltage gain, more precise current control , and improved stability compared to a resistor. Additionally, using a MOSFET can make the circuit more temperature stable and less sensitive to variations in transistor parameters. The MOSFET also helps in maintaining a constant current through the differential pair, reducing distortion and improving the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), ultimately enhancing overall performance and efficiency.

## Results:

‚Ä¢ DC Analysis: The drain current was 0.5 mA, meeting the specifications for Vocm, Vp, and power consumption (P ‚â§ 2.2 mW).

‚Ä¢ Transient Analysis: The amplifier showed a 180-degree phase shift with an output gain of 12.067 dB (4.012), confirming the expected amplification.

‚Ä¢ AC Analysis: The amplifier's frequency response was stable, with the theoretical gain matching the practical results across frequencies.
 
## Inference:

In this experiment, we explored the operation and design of a differential amplifier using LTSpice. We found that the differential amplifier effectively rejects common-mode signals while amplifying differential-mode signals, which makes it a key component in operational amplifier (op-amp) design.

We tested three different configurations of the differential amplifier: one with a resistor (Rss), another with a current source (Iss), and a third using an NMOS transistor as a current source in the saturation region.

Of the three configurations, the NMOS current-source design achieved the highest gain of 12.067 dB. However, it exhibited some instability in its frequency response, with noticeable fluctuations before reaching the midband, likely due to the NMOS transistor's characteristics. The current-source configuration proved to be more stable, providing consistent Iss values that closely matched our theoretical predictions and showing less sensitivity to temperature variations. In comparison, the Rss configuration was reliable but more affected by temperature fluctuations and resistance tolerance errors, which could impact current values and power budget.

Overall, the differential amplifier demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing noise by measuring the difference between two drain voltages. A critical factor to note is the need for two perfectly matched N-channel MOSFETs. In LTSpice, we were able to implement this easily using the 180 nm TSMC .lib technology file.
